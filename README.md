# multi-instance-docker-dokuwiki
Multi-instance webservice that allows users to create their own instances of DokuWiki. Something like fandom.org on DokuWiki on Docker.

## Directory structure
- /core_engines - folder with dokuwiki core files, plugins and templates. Each directory inside this folder should be listed in dokuwiki versions.

- /user_data - folder with user configuration files of their dokuwiki instance.
